I am Mateusz Nurek, a final-year PhD student in Computer Science at Wrocław University of Science and Technology in Poland, supervised by Prof. Radosław Michalski. I am a computer scientist by training, with a strong interest in interdisciplinary research that combines computer science and the social sciences. My main research areas are **temporal networks** and **social network analysis**. In my work, I explore how theories from cognitive science can support various network science problems, such as **temporal link prediction**, **opinion dynamics**, and **social learning**. Recently, I have also become interested in **higher-order link prediction**.
